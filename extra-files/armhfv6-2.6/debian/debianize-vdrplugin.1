.SH NAME
debianize-vdrplugin \- debianize a VDR plugin source archive
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B debianize-vdrplugin
can be used to add a working debian-directory to the source-directory 
of a vdr-plugin.

.B debianize-vdrplugin
should be called directly from a plugin-source-directory.

After
.B debianize-vdrplugin 
was run, you should check the files inside the debian-directory if they 
fit your needs, and modify them accordingly.

The next step to get a debian-package for the vdr-plugin is to call
.B dpkg-buildpackage
(You need the package 
.B dpkg-dev
for this tool.)
